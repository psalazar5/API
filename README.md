# API Documentation

This repository houses a comprehensive ASP.NET 6.0 web API project, showcasing best practices, architectural patterns, and a robust backend setup. The project primarily focuses on providing an API to interact with Pokemon data, utilizing various technologies and methodologies.

## Key Features:

## 1. ASP.NET 6.0 Web API:
* Built using the latest version of ASP.NET, embracing the latest features and improvements.
* Integrated Swagger for API documentation, offering an interactive and user-friendly API exploration experience.
## 2. Database Interaction:
* Entity Framework Core is employed for seamless interaction with a SQL Server database.
* Detailed steps are provided for creating the database schema, seeding initial data, and handling database migrations.
## 3. Repository Pattern & Dependency Injection:
* Utilizes the repository pattern for organized and maintainable data access logic.
* Implements dependency injection for loose coupling and easy component swapping.
## 4. DTO Implementation:
* Implements Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to limit the data returned by API endpoints, ensuring sensitive information is protected.
## 5. Automapper & Mapping Profiles:
* Leverages Automapper to simplify the mapping process between entity models and DTOs.
* Organizes mapping configurations in dedicated classes for clean and extendable code.
## 6. CategoryRepository Model (Part 2):
* Extends the project by introducing a CategoryRepository model, demonstrating the extensibility of the architecture.
